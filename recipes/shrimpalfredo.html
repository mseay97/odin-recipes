        <p>A Delicious and creamy Shrimp Alfredo that is perfect for any day. This is such a speedy recipe. 
        All you have to do is boil some pasta, sauté the shrimp, and prepare the sauce—which takes all of five minutes</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>12 oz. Fettuccine</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. Jumbo shrimp, peeled</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li> 2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup fresh parsley chopped</li>
       </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain but do not rinse. </li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and the butter has melted, add the shrimp and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are pink and cooked, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Quickly remove the shrimp to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the heavy cream and remaining 10 tablespoons butter to the drippings in the skillet and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, reducing the heat as needed to make sure it doesn't boil. Stir in the garlic and 1 1/2 cups of the parmesan. Add the shrimp and pasta to the skillet and coat in the sauce, then add the parsley and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the pasta with the remaining 1/2 cup parmesan and more parsley. Serve straight from the skillet.</li>
       </ol>
